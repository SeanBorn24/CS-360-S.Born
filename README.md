# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app that i developed is an inventory tracking application, it is designed to authenticate an end user using a password and username to ensure security. After the user is signed in the application is designed to ass, remove, increase, and decrease items asdded into a database. The application can send an alert to a user is the stock reaches zero using a radio button in the settings. The inventory is also organized into a grid view. 
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There are four screens that include a login, gridviewm settings and notification, and add items flow. Keeping the user in mibd the UI screens use a variety of colors that stay within the tenme. Each screen also flows to one another within it confusing or misleading the user. 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I apprached the coding in chunks to make my process a bit more organized. I worked with one screen at a time. I also had to use many outside sources to help me because this part was the most difficult for me. 
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To make sute that my code was functional I tested it on an emulated device with different screen sizes. 
# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
To overcome the challenges that I had I watched several tutorials and read lits of forems to get my code to function properly with the UI. 
# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I really enjoyed designing the UI aspect of the application. I really struggled with the coding it to get it to function part of the project.
